# Ankit Bagchi - Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Overview

Using the Bootstrap CSS Framework, I've created a minimalist responsive portfolio site.

I utilize my own images and artwork as placeholders, treating the site as a skeleton for a future iteration that includes a more robust portfolio of work. For the time being, text on my `portfolio.html` page has been left as Lorem Ipsum.

Though the form on my `contact.html` page has not been linked to my email via PHP, a small footer can be found at the bottom of each page linking to my GitHub account, and all navigation links work properly.

A separate stylesheet called `style.css` was created to style my elements beyond default Bootstrap styles. Because overwriting default styles can difficult when using such a framework, certain styles were not able to be properly implemented. I've left some of these in the stylesheet with a comment to warn of their redundancies.

- Using Bootstrap, I developed my portfolio site with the following items:

  - A navbar

  - A responsive layout

  - Responsive images

### Minimum Requirements met in this assignment

- Functional, deployed application

- GitHub repository with README describing the project

- Navbar containing links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages consistent on each page.

- All links work.

- Uses semantic html.

- Each page has valid HTML.

- Contains my personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

- Utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

- My attempt at including a minimalist footer linking to my GitHub account may have used a more and unreasonable approach than necessary.
